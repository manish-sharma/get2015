      <h1>Failing is Good</h1>
      <p>A biology teacher was teaching his students how a caterpillar        turns into a butterfly. He told the students
	  that in the next          couple of hours, the butterfly would struggle to come out of            the cocoon. But no one should help the butterfly.
	  Then he left.
      </p>
      <p>The students were waiting and it happened. The butterfly struggled to get out of the cocoon,
	  and one of the students took pity on it and decided to help the butterfly out of the cocoon against 
	  the advice of his teacher. He broke the cocoon to help the butterfly so it didn’t have to struggle anymore. But shortly afterwards the butterfly died.
      </p>
      <p>When the teacher returned, he was told what happened. He explained to this student that by helping the butterfly, he had actually killed it because
	  it is a law of nature that the struggle to come out of the cocoon actually helps develop and strengthen its wings. The boy had deprived the butterfly 
	  of its struggle and the butterfly died.</p>
       <p>Apply this same principle to our lives. Nothing worthwhile in life comes without a struggle. As parents we tend to hurt the ones we love most because
	   we don’t allow them to struggle to gain strength

 I have shared  few more personal experiences  of Failures in life to explain my concept.
</p><p>
 I run a  company which helps student prepare for one of the most Prestigious IT Certification called CCIE ( Cisco Certified Internetwork Expert)  .Remember i
 just used the word most prestigious which is directly proportional to quite complex .Everything that Prestigious is complex to achieve and if everybody can 
 achieve it then it cannot be prestigious .I meet a lot of my students on daily basis who failed and came to meet me to ask for improvement plan .When I ask 
 them their score ,they are always very close almost failed by 1% or 2 % marks .I have not seen a student who failed every by a gap of 30% marks .Despite of
 failing ,we have the best passing rate in CCIE Exams in first and second attempt ,our first attempt passing rate is around 40% while second attempt passing 
 rate is about 89% .Means anybody who has failed in first attempt is almost sure to pass in next if he failed with small gap .I ask them the reason of failures 
 and they generally have a clear idea of where they failed .I feel happy to know my students have a clarity on each section and reason of failure .When this happens 
 ,they prepare with great enthusiasm .Each student prepares his strategy to beat complex section and this leads to them attaining the most prestigious certifications 
 .We have been a leader in  passing results and no one in the world is close .Only last year we have produced close to 250 Total CCIE while nearest competitor in USA 
 has not produced over 50 CCIEs .Our training infrastructure is one of the Largest in the World and we did not believe this till the time external Trainers confirmed 
 this to us as they have worked for most of big players in India and USA .
</p><p>
 On placement side ,I take care of personality development to interview preparation and results have been tremendous again .But this did not happen overnight 
 ,5 years of hardwork and learning from failures have resulted in creating one of the best Training company in India .We have never repeated a failure or  mistake 
 again and that made all the difference .

 What do you do when you are travelling somewhere on your bike or car and it gets punctured on the way .Do you leave the bike on road and cancel your journey or you
 get it fixed and start again to reach to your destination .
</p><p>
 As we know MIT ,Harvard ,Stanford are very prestigious institutes in the World like IIM and IIT in India are the most prestigious educational institutes. Millions 
 of students try for admission into these institutions however only few thousand are able to make it .Rest all fail .What happens to those who could not reach to IIT 
 ,IIM or Harvard university , they get selected into Next Best College .I have a friend of mine who use to prepare for IIT Examination and was really passionate about 
 getting into IIT .However even after trying 2 times ,he could not secure an admission into IIT however due to his preparation for IIT level exam he was selected in 
 REC Delhi(Another World Class Institute) .Do you count it  a less achievement in any sense  ? I have many other friends who never prepared for anything big and 
 ended up in small local colleges in their local city .They never tried for anything big so never got even half of it .
</p><p>
I would like to share some of the biggest inspirations for me which I have followed to deal with failures and they have lead me toward great Personal and Professional


 Success in Life .
</p>
 <h4>Larry Page and Sergey Bin -Google</h4>
      <p>
No need of introduction. In 1998 Google sets up workspace in Susan Wojcicki’s garage at 232 , Santa Margarita, Men-lo park and Larry and Sergey hire Craig
 Silverstein as their first employee. Rest is history. They too failed first. They approached Yahoo in their earlier years for selling the idea. But the reply 
 was NO. Then what happened. Now Google is bigger than Yahoo.
</p><p>

Nowadays people tend to give more focus on failures. They easily come to the conclusion that they are not capable of doing it. Any one who believes he can do it,
 can do it hundreds of times if he try it for 99 times. There is no short cut to success. Success can be achieved only by hard work and practice. Without these thing 
 success will always elude you. All success people have short comings. All failed people too have short comings. The difference is that success people try hard to impair their shortcomings but failed one repent and live and die along with their shortcomings.
</p><p>

<h4>Steve Jobs -Apple</h4>
Steve Jobs need no introduction to anybody in the world. But you know he had slept in the floor of friends’s door rooms. He returned coke bottles for money. Steve 
jobs while in India, regularly got weekly free meals from local temple. A below par student as per the teachers of his school. But how he made Billions. Sheer
 hard work and confidence in his abilities. Perseverance and sticking to his strengths and proving that he means business. Rest is history.

<h4>Warren Buffet</h4>
As a young boy, he delivered newspapers and filed his first tax return at age 13 – and he claimed $35 deduction for the bicycle he bought. Now he is the second 
richest person in the world.
<p>
The theme behind all the stories are that these leaders dream big. Really big.

           American basketball star Michael Jordan was born on February 17, 1963, in Brooklyn, New York. Jordan left college after his junior year to join the NBA.
		   Drafted by the Chicago Bulls, he helped the team make it to the playoffs. For his efforts there, Jordan received the NBA Rookie of the Year Award.
		   With five regular-season MVPs and three All-Star MVPs, Jordan became the most decorated player in the NBA.

        <h1>Michael Jordan: The Wizard Years (Documentary)</h1>
        <p>
            There is a perception that Jordan's Wizards years were atrocious, but this is only half true. Before Jordan's knee injury, his stint with the Wizards
			was going very well. The Wizards only went downhill after his knee injury on Feb 7, 2002 against the Kings. Let's take a look at Wizards Jordan from 
			the beginning.

        While preparing for his return, Jordan's ribs were injured by Ron Artest during a pickup game. Jordan rushed his return to training, and Tim Grover advised against 
           this due to tendonitis risk. Jordan overworked himself and his knees became a problem. 

         Before the season started, Jordan was already dealing with 
         - having to skip 3 days of practice before the season opener in MSG because of fluid buildup in his knee 
         - recovering from 2 broken ribs (against Artest) and back spasms
        - tendinitis in his knee and wrist
        - and during the season Jordan had fluid drained from his knee multiple times

          So even before his knee injury, he was already in a hobbled state
