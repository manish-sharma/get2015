			<h1>Article on 'Lifelong Learning In Today's Business World'</h1>
			<p>
			The Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), which are subject to connectivity,
			have been established as something inherent in peopleâ€™s lives and have completely transformed
			the way in which we interact with the world, mix with others, learn, collaborate, socialize,
			work, produce, and even the way in which we think and feel. These activities are not independent;
			on the contrary, they blend in and nourish each other, marking up a symbiotic relationship.<br><br>
			Therefore, we assume that the changes produced on how we obtain information have also involved 
			the modification of our habits on content consumption. For example, the average amount of time
			that a user devotes to the reading of a piece of news has been significantly reduced. The same
			happens regarding web pages: Visitors decide in just a few seconds whether the information that 
			is being offered is relevant and interesting for them or not. This tendency only strengthens as 
			the time devoted to navigate grows and a greater diversity of information is consulted. That is 
			to say, the level of depth at which we immerse ourselves in content has diminished.<br><br>
			Analyzing the impact these changes can entail in people in the future is not a simple task. 
			The evidence is that we consume information in a way that is different from the traditional 
			one, searching for immediate answers or solutions that deal with everyday challenges. 
			These are comprehensive changes.<br><br>
			At working level, they affect the communication between the company and its clients, its own employees,
			the infrastructures, the work dynamics etc., and especially training processes.
			We are witnessing not just a technological issue, but a more profound revolution:
			A paradigm shift in communication and social relationships.<a href="#"> read more.......<br><br>
