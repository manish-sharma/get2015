.andSelf()     : Add the previous set of elements on the stack to the current set.

.children()    : Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector.

.closest()     : For each element in the set, get the first element that matches the selector by testing the element itself 
                and traversing up through its ancestors in the DOM tree.
                
.contents()    : Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, including text and comment nodes.

.each()        : Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element.

.end()         : End the most recent filtering operation in the current chain and return the set of matched elements to its previous state.

.eq()          : Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index.

.find()        : Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element.

.first()       : Reduce the set of matched elements to the first in the set.

.has()         : Reduce the set of matched elements to those that have a descendant that matches the selector or DOM element.

.is()          : Check the current matched set of elements against a selector, element, 
                or jQuery object and return true if at least one of these elements matches the given arguments.
                
.last()        : Reduce the set of matched elements to the final one in the set.

.map()         : Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values.

.next()        : Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements.
