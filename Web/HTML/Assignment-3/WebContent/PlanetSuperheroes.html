		<h1>Zack Snyder Says that "Batman vs Superman:Dawn Of Justice" is
			Man Of Steel 2</h1>
		<p>There has been a lot of conversation about what a "Man of Steel
			2" would look like, and even whether or not there's another
			stand-alone Superman film in the works at Warner Bros. As it turns
			out, Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice director (also working on the
			upcoming two-part Justice League movie, and director of Man of Steel)
			Zack Snyder already addressed this in a September 10, 2015 interview
			with Canoe.com. "I think in a way Batman v Superman is Man of Steel
			2. Justice League is kind of the transcendent,
			knights-of-the-round-table of the story. It'd be interesting to think
			about what a standalone Superman movie might be," Snyder said when
			asked about a stand-alone sequel. That fits in with the general
			narrative around the film, including its direct follow-up on
			Superman's destructive first two major battles in Man of Steel, and
			the way even the trailer links the two movies together. Heck, even
			screenwriter and Superman fan Max Landis's pitch for a direct sequel
			sounds more like Dawn of Justice than an issue of a Superman comic
			book. When WB and DCE announced their superhero movie line-up, both
			Batman and Superman solo films were left off the list, with a caveat
			that both were also in development. Since then, however, we've heard
			many rumors about Batman movies, including one being co-written by
			Bruce Wayne actor Ben Affleck and DCE CCO Geoff Johns, but virtually
			nothing about Superman's solo cinematic future. For his part, Zack
			Snyder is focused much more on the "mythology" of the Justice League
			heroes, something he hopes Dawn of Justice will help build ahead of
			the team films.</p>
