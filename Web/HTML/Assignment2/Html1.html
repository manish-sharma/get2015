Despite popular belief, a reliance on a single food which composes the majority of a diet is indicative of poor eating habits. An individual on such a diet may be prone to deficiency and most certainly will not be fulfilling the Recommended Nutrient Intake.

The importance at present of a Healthy diet is something which is actually receiving many promotions throughout several countries due to obesity epidemics. Governments, particularly in the United Kingdom, through the advice of the Department of Health, 
introduced a public health white paper to parliament, CM 6374, which aimed to deal with the issues presented by particularly imported culture 
cigarettes, alcohol and fast food all being produced in their majority in the United States, or by US-based companies.
