								<p> I've been long overdue in sending you and the team at Metacube a note of thanks and appreciation for all your hard work and dedication.  My team reminds me on a very regular basis regarding how responsive, professional and thorough your group has been and that they are a pleasure to work with.
You have been exceeding our expectations from the very beginning and we will continue to grow and scale the business with you based on your excellent service to us and our customers.  I have personally worked with and outsourced to Tier 1 and a number of other mid-tier Indian SI's and by far this is the best experience I have had to date.
