			<h3>Amazon Fire TV, Fire TV Stick Updated With Slew Of New
				Features</h3>

			<p class="paragraph">
				Amazon's Fire TV and Fire TV Stick were undoubtedly two of the
				coolest gadgets released in 2014. However, Amazon is pushing to make
				its streaming devices even better in 2015 thanks to over-the-air
				software upgrades that are scheduled to roll out to consumers over
				the next several weeks.<br> One of the biggest new features
				Amazon is implementing in both devices is the ability to connect to
				wireless networks that require web authentication. Amazon indicated
				that this service will work in most hotel rooms and "some"
				universities. The two streaming devices will also include a new
				shortcut that makes putting the device to sleep easier, as well as a
				shortcut to enable display mirroring.

			<h2>Intro: Preparing & Packaging for Amazon</h2>
			<p class="paragraph">Product packaging is more than simply
				putting your product in a box. Packaging encompasses a whole slew of
				considerations that can either directly or indirectly affect the
				entire process from product creation and manufacturing to customer
				use. This simple fact is why we have dedicated an entire section of
				this series to your product itself. Even if you are simply a
				reseller or vendor, or just getting rid of your pre-owned goods,
				there are still factors to consider when it comes to your product,
				itâ€™s packaging, and shipping.</p>
