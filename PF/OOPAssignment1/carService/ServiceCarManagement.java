/**
 *Assignment 4: Apply oopâ€™s technique learned in session
Car Service Appointment System
Console based application to manage car service appointments for a day.
Modelling the Operations of a Service Station
We need to create a design and implement the operations of a Car Service Station.
A Service Station has many Persons (Mechanics , Manager , Staff etc. ) which work in the service station.

The Service Station services multiple Cars (Which can be a Sedan , Hatchback or SUV ) every day .

Every car is serviced by a mechanic who specializes in servicing a particular type of a car. For example a Mechanic specializing in SUV will be able to service a SUV Car.

The service station has a list of Mechanic working in the office.
The service station has a list of Cars entering the center for servicing.
The service station maintains the assignment of the work (i.e. which mechanic is working on which car)

Each car has a different rate for servicing. For example rate of SUV can be 5000 while the rate of the Sedan can be 3000 Rs .
Input
Setting up the Mechanics 
You can load list of the Mechanics from a file (You can use  InputFileReader/BufferedReader )
The way you can store the data in CSV format (Comma Separated Values)

The format of data in the file can be (Name, Type, Rate)
Mechanic1 , SUV , 5000   
Mechanic2 , Sedan , 3000

You can read from the file can create the objects.
Reading the car input,,,
You can load the list of cars arriving in the service center from the file.
You can keep the format of the data as (Car Number, Car Type)
SUV
SUV
Sedan
Hatchback
Sedan

Output
 
After reading the data print 

How many cars are serviced by each type 

Example : 
SUV : 5
Sedan : 10 
Hatchbak : 3

2. What was the total earning

Example 
12000 Rs
